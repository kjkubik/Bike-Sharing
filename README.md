Note: I didn't find this lesson very realistic.  That is, NYC and Des Moines, IA are so
demographically different, I don't know if my company should be presenting NYC
data. It doesn't seem very smart. Instead of doing the lesson, I found myself
online trying to convince myself bike-sharing in Des Moines was feasible.

I found:

1) Bicycle graveyards:

2) Need for significate government funding and other
   donation
3) Issues surrounding bike sharing:

Honestly, integrity-wise, I might have an issue with continuing
on this project. I would be sure to talk to my managers about this.
